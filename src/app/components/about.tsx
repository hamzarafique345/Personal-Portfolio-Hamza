              Hello everyone! I wanted to share a little bit about myself. I
              recently passed my intermediate in medical, but I realized that my
              true passion lies in the IT field. It was a difficult decision,
              but I took a leap of faith and joined the Governor Initiative
              program. At first, I faced many challenges, but thanks to my
              amazing mentor Mehak Alamgir, I was able to overcome them. Now, I
              have successfully completed my first quarter and I am currently
              working on the second quarter, which is all about Next.js. Mehak
              Alamgir has been an incredible guide and support throughout this
              journey. I am grateful for this opportunity and excited for what's
              to come.
            </p>
